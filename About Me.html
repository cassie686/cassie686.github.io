									<h1> More About Me</h1>

								</div>

									<p>
										I define myself as a curious mind, a systems thinker, and an explorer of energy &amp; sustainability.
										I’m fascinated by those spaces where ideas collide—where
										<strong>disciplines intersect</strong>, <strong>perspectives converge</strong>, and
										<strong>opposing forces</strong> find balance.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										These tensions—between <strong>progress and sustainability</strong>,
										<strong>efficiency and resilience</strong>, and
										<strong>short-term gains and long-term impact</strong>—shape not only how I think but also how I act.
										They define the problems I work on and the questions I ask.
										And if you’ve ever tried to explain why a <strong>carbon tax</strong> matters at a dinner party,
										you already know that navigating these tensions isn’t just an intellectual exercise—it’s an
										<strong>endurance sport</strong>.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										Before pursuing my master’s degree in the United States, I spent four years in Shanghai as a
										financial analyst at a solid waste disposal company. It was my job to analyze financial statements
										from hundreds of project companies, focusing especially on <strong>accounts receivable</strong>.
										Through wrestling with spreadsheets and risk assessments day in and day out, I gained a foundational
										understanding of <strong>subsidies</strong> and <strong>tariff mechanisms</strong> within the
										renewable energy sector. I realized this was a promising, constantly evolving market—and rather than
										remain in the comfort of a familiar role, I decided to take a risk, resign, and
										<strong>reinvent myself</strong> through further education. After all, I’ve never been one to wait
										around for the perfect answer; if the opportunity isn’t knocking, I’d rather build the door myself.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										Once I arrived in the U.S., I found myself juggling a one-and-a-half-year master’s program with
										multiple projects that I either initiated or joined. (If you’re an HR professional reading this,
										<strong>yes, I can absolutely multitask</strong>.) I’ve always believed that
										<strong>failure isn’t a dead end—it’s the tuition we pay for insight</strong>.
										If you’re never wrong, you’re probably not learning fast enough. The more I explore, the more I
										realize that beneath every complex system lies a surprisingly similar logic:
										<strong>patterns repeat</strong>, <strong>constraints shape outcomes</strong>, and
										<strong>leverage points often hide in plain sight</strong>.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										Somewhere along the way, I also ended up leading the organization of a high-level summit, bringing
										together <strong>senior government officials</strong>, <strong>industry stakeholders</strong>, and
										<strong>leading academics</strong> around a common table. (Turns out a few determined phone calls and
										emails can go a long way.) I didn’t wait for them to come to me; I actively sought them out, fueled
										by my conviction that genuine breakthroughs often occur at the intersection of policy, markets, and
										research. This experience not only sharpened my leadership and project management skills but also
										reminded me how crucial it is to bridge different perspectives if we want to create real impact.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										Perhaps that’s why I gravitate toward <strong>non-fiction</strong> in my spare time. Books that seem
										unrelated to my work—from <strong>markets</strong> to <strong>technology</strong> to
										<strong>human behavior</strong>—often contain underlying principles that <strong>rhyme</strong>.
										Sometimes, the most powerful solutions come from unexpected places, and connecting ideas across
										disciplines is what turns problem-solving into an art.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										That’s also why I consider myself a <strong>long-term thinker</strong>. The best short-term solution
										is rarely the best long-term one, and I’d rather build for endurance than optimize for immediacy.
										My journey—spanning <strong>energy, sustainability, and emerging technologies</strong>—reflects this
										philosophy. Whether <strong>co-authoring white papers</strong> or helping launch
										<strong>early-stage initiatives</strong>, I’ve worked at the edges of systems, learning how
										<strong>markets</strong>, <strong>grids</strong>, and <strong>networks</strong> evolve under
										pressure. I don’t have all the answers—maybe I never will—but if you, too, are drawn to asking the
										right questions, challenging assumptions, and building something that truly lasts, let’s connect.
										Together, we can navigate these tensions, turn risks into opportunities, and create meaningful
										impact over the long haul.
									  </p>

									  <p>
										Just maybe don’t ask me to predict next year’s energy stock prices—I’m good, but not
										that good.

								<h2>Financial Analyst<br></h2>
								<h3>@ Shanghai Environment Group Co., Ltd</h3>
							</header>

								<p>I started my career at <strong>Shanghai Environment Group</strong>, a company specializing in solid waste treatment and biomass energy—technically part of the renewable energy sector. As a <strong>Financial Analyst</strong>, my primary focus was <strong>accounts receivable analysis</strong> across nearly a hundred project subsidiaries, tracking revenue streams from <strong>renewable energy subsidies and electricity sales to the grid</strong>. This role was my first real exposure to <strong>energy markets and power systems</strong>—a field I quickly became fascinated with.</p>

								<p>Over time, I developed expertise in <strong>financial modeling and policy impact analysis</strong>, translating regulatory changes into quantifiable business outcomes. One of my key responsibilities was conducting <strong>sensitivity analyses on CNY 800M+ receivables</strong>, assessing how policy shifts could impact outstanding payments and future profitability. I also built <strong>data validation systems</strong> that improved financial reporting accuracy, identifying and correcting <strong>CNY 20M in discrepancies across 260 accounts</strong>—because, as it turns out, numbers don’t always behave themselves.</p>

								<p>Beyond financial analysis, I took on <strong>project management and strategic decision-making</strong> responsibilities. I consolidated <strong>budget proposals from 52 project companies</strong>, ensuring compliance and flagging anomalies for senior management. I also played a key role in the <strong>due diligence process for a HKD 61.1 billion landfill project</strong>, conducting <strong>profitability assessments, cost evaluations, and feasibility analyses</strong>.</p>

								<p>One particularly rewarding aspect of my work was contributing to <strong>international business expansion</strong>. Leveraging my <strong>cross-cultural communication skills</strong>, I collaborated with the marketing department on <strong>bidding for overseas landfill projects</strong>, preparing <strong>financial reports, profitability forecasts, and joint venture cost assessments</strong>—equipping leadership with the data they needed to make strategic decisions.</p>

								<p>In <strong>2022, I was awarded "Best Employee of Finance Department"</strong> in my department, a recognition of my commitment to data-driven decision-making and analytical rigor. While I valued the experience and stability, I realized that solid waste treatment is just a small piece of the renewable energy puzzle. Driven by a desire for continuous learning, bigger challenges, and broader impact, I made the decision to step out of my comfort zone and explore new frontiers in <strong>energy and sustainability</strong>.</p>

								<p>From <strong>financial analysis to policy-driven forecasting</strong>, my experience at Shanghai Environment Group gave me a <strong>front-row seat to the intersection of finance, energy, and regulation</strong>—a perspective that continues to shape my journey today.</p>
